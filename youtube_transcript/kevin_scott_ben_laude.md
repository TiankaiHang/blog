BEN LAUDE:
Maybe one day we will be comparing Horowitz and Perahia's Chopin Ballade to 
AI's different version
of it, and we can input. Well, I want to hear an AI
play it with this expression. 
Is that coming? Should we be concerned, or
what do you think? KEVIN SCOTT:
Hi, everyone. 
Welcome to Behind the Tech. I'm Kevin Scott, Chief
Technology Officer, and EVP of AI at Microsoft. 
Today, tech is a part of nearly every aspect
of our lives. We're in the early days of an
AI revolution promising to 
transform our lived experiences as much as any
technology ever has. On this podcast, we'll
talk with the folks 
behind the technology and
explore the motivations, passion, and curiosity
driving them to create the tech shaping our
world. Let's get started. 
CHRISTINA WARREN:
Hello, and welcome to Behind the Tech. I'm co-host Christina Warren, Senior Developer
Advocate at GitHub. 
KEVIN SCOTT:
I'm Kevin Scott. CHRISTINA WARREN:
Now, before we introduce our guest, we wanted to take a
minute to share with y'all that we are planning an 
ask me anything or AMA episode with Kevin in the coming months. KEVIN SCOTT:
Yeah, that's right. 
We would love to hear your questions on
any topic at all, from AI to sci-fi, 
to woodworking, or my latest obsession,
which is pottery. Funny enough, as we
are recording this, 
I have a kiln heating up to many thousands of degrees Fahrenheit right
now firing pottery. 
Or we can talk about piano, which is the episode that
we're recording today. 
Anything that's on your mind, please feel free to
reach out to us, and we will try to 
give good answers to
your good questions. CHRISTINA WARREN:
Yeah, absolutely. I'm really excited to see 
what questions come in. If you have a
question for Kevin, you can send us an e-mail
or a voice note to 
behindthetech@microsoft.com, that's
behindthetech@microsoft.com. 
Please include your
name and a way to reach out if you have
follow-up questions. Please keep voice notes to
no longer than 90 seconds. 
Once again, that e-mail is
behindthetech@microsoft.com. KEVIN SCOTT:
Awesome. 
I'm really looking
forward to that. CHRISTINA WARREN:
Me too. Now we can dive into our
interview for today, 
which I'm really
looking forward to. Our guest today is a musician. Ben Laude is a concert pianist 
who has performed
all over the world, and he's also a long-time
music educator, both in traditional
education settings 
and as a YouTube creator. KEVIN SCOTT:
Look, I don't 
know whether I'm
breaking news here, but I tend to get obsessed
about very particular things, 
and one of the things that
I've been obsessed about since I was a teenager
is classical piano. 
I'm just super excited in general to talk to Ben
because I think he's making some of the best
educational content 
about classical piano
anywhere in the world. It's just a miracle that 
these resources are
available for folks who happen to have this
particular obsession. 
But I think it's actually
more relevant even than satisfying my desire 
to have a conversation
with a fellow piano nerd, because we're at
this point in time where people are thinking a lot 
about what AI means
for art and artists. 
I think that there is a bunch of stuff that
we can chat about with 
Ben to try to get a little
clearer in our head about, 
what maybe things like AI
are going to mean for art. 
It's a hard conversation to
have in general because I think if you ask 100 artists
to define what art is, 
you would get 100
different definitions. But it is one of 
the most essentially
human things that we have as a species is the art that we make for ourselves
and for each other, 
and so I'm really excited to have this
conversation with Ben, given that he's thought
so critically about what 
makes the performance of classical piano a
compelling thing. 
CHRISTINA WARREN:
Absolutely. I'm really, really looking forward to this conversation.
Let's go over to Ben. 
KEVIN SCOTT:
Ben Laude is an adjunct professor of music, piano, literature and aural skills
at Utah State University, 
and a YouTube creator devoted to popularizing classical
piano content. He's an accomplished
concert pianist, 
whose playing has been
described by the New York Times as "superb in pace,
tone and eloquence." 
He was the head of the Tonebase piano platform for four years, and he's currently
working on a video and podcast series
exploring the work 
of composer Frederic Chopin and his relevance to
the 21st century. Ben holds degrees in
piano performance 
from Rice University and
the Juilliard School. Ben, thanks so much for joining
us on the podcast today. 
I've been really looking
forward to this one. BEN LAUDE:
Thanks, Kevin, likewise. KEVIN SCOTT:
We always start 
these conversations by going back to people's beginnings. You're obviously
an amazing piano 
and music educator
and a performer. How did you get
onto that journey? 
When did you know that this
is what you wanted to do? BEN LAUDE:
Well, unlike some of my peers in the
classical music world, 
I didn't come from a
strictly musical family. There was music in
my family, though. 
My dad has dabbled at the piano, but he himself is a
chemistry professor 
and administrator at UT Austin. I grew up in the
suburbs of Austin, Texas, middle-class, 
and parents split up. But basically, I had a normal 1990s childhood,
early Internet, 
lots of TV, sports, and a little bit of
Chopin and Beethoven 
started filling
the air around me. At night, my dad would
come home from his lab 
and try his hand at the beginning of
Chopin's first nocturne, and so this intoxicating
melody just, 
I guess, seeped into
my nervous system. 
Reportedly, I don't
remember this exactly. Reportedly, I would come and stare at my dad when he would try to play and eventually, 
I think it was pretty
clear I needed to start piano lessons around age 5. 
But in terms of how
I ended up here, lots of people take
piano lessons, but like I usually say, 
you're supposed to quit
around age 11 or 12. You're not supposed to keep
doing it. That's weird. 
I got really lucky, or
you can say unlucky depending on whether
you think a career of music is a good idea, 
but I got really lucky
right around high school. I got a new teacher who 
actually set my
technique straight. I had maybe some talent before, but it wasn't really realized. 
Again, I had a lot
of other priorities. I wasn't being pushed to
become some virtuoso. 
There was a turning point
around eighth or ninth grade. I was starting to feel
something for the music. 
In fact, it was a
Chopin prelude I remember listening to
in the eighth grade. Suddenly, and again, this is
right around early puberty. 
Hormones are starting. One of the many things that
happened in early puberty was this music started
to matter to me. 
I felt something
new and different, and not exactly something I wanted to go brag to my
friends about at school. 
It became this private
obsession and I just became 
a ravenous collector of music scores and
piano recordings, 
and I wanted to get better. I started practicing more, and I went from playing with 
flat fingers and barely
making my way through a Bach invention in
middle school to 
playing Saint-SaÃ«ns and Rachmaninoff
concertos by my sophomore and junior year of high school. There was this great
leap that happened that 
was also happening
at the same time that my interest in the art
form was being stimulated, and so I was lucky
to have a father and 
a mother who were encouraging when I told them, I
want to be a pianist. I want to go study
this in college. 
That's how it all got
started in a nutshell. KEVIN SCOTT:
How important do you think 
that feedback loop is to people getting escape
velocity into a profession? 
Like what you described
that you started, you had a new teacher. 
I wonder how important
the Internet was to finding community
to fuel your obsession. 
But it sounds like
the important thing is this feedback loop where
all of a sudden you just 
started progressing faster and feeling better and differently 
about the things
that you were doing. I felt the same way when I
was young about programming. 
I've got a daughter
right now who's 16, who's in the feedback
loop for the biosciences. 
It's just cool to see
that hit someone. BEN LAUDE:
Nothing has ever made me feel 
the way Chopin nocturnes
and polonaises, and Beethoven sonatas
made me feel, 
or Rachmaninoff
concertos started to make me feel at high school. I don't know how to describe it. I don't feel the way
now that I felt then. 
I wish I could go back and
experience that magic again. But I feel like the world's been 
a bit disenchanted for
me as I grow older, and so maybe some
of my videos are 
an attempt to re-enchant
things for myself too. But at the time, I always
had obsessions as a kid. 
I would become fixated
on some aspect of culture or subject. Piano, in a way, was just
another one of those. 
But because it was so
much deeper than say, my obsession with
yoyos or juggling. 
No offense to those
performing arts, but piano has a rich
history and legacy, 
and it's just infinitely deep. I was also just fascinated
by the fact that 
these encoded scores could be manifest in sound. If
that makes any sense. 
It's like some guy
who wrote this down 200 years ago in hieroglyphics, and I'm able to decipher it
and then bring it to life. 
That was magical to me. That was really cool to
me, and so this obsession, 
just I think, because
I got a good teacher, that teacher was able to
push me and develop it. 
It could have just been
another passing phase or fad for me. But something clicked and 
it's all I cared about
for a bit there. KEVIN SCOTT:
I'm just curious, 
you in one of your videos you're holding
up video cassettes, of the Horowitz Last Romantic, 
and you're talking about
the '78 performance of the Rach 3 that he did. 
I had a whole bunch of those reference points
when I was a kid. I think I'm a reasonable
bit older than you are. 
Growing up in the '70s and '80s, I got connected to
classical music 
because Horowitz was a
little bit of a celebrity. Not a huge celebrity, 
like mainstream wise, but he had done this televised concert from
Carnegie Hall in 1968, 
that was before I was
born, but got replayed, and then I remember he did
this interview on 60 Minutes, 
I believe, right
when he was about to do his tour of Moscow, 
and there was a little bit of this Cold War dimension
where it's like, our pianists are better than 
your pianists at that point in time and it was just enough to 
get me super fascinated by this, which was just as
weird for me to be 
fascinated as
probably was for you. I was the only kid 
in my circle who was listening
to Vladimir Horowitz, and Vladimir Ashkenazy, 
and Van Cliburn, Martha Argerich CDs or 
cassette tapes even
before CDs existed. How did you find community? 
It sounds like you
had good teachers, but was there anything else? Because this is one of
the things I think you're 
doing an extraordinary job of, is giving these resources for people who have
this fascination. 
BEN LAUDE:
In a way, I'm just creating videos for my younger self that I wish
had existed back then, 
but yeah, I probably wouldn't be here
without the early Internet, which you probably feel 
some nostalgia for that
early Internet as well. Again, my father is a professor, 
so I grew up crawling
around his lab in the mid '90s and he
had the Internet. 
Around then, I was probably playing video
games with my brother, and we would get
online and look up 
Resident Evil cheat codes for PlayStation,
things like that. But message boards were
the main, at least for me, 
thing to do on the Internet in the late '90s and early 2000s, and it was around 
2000 that I developed
this piano obsession. Of course, I ran to get online, 
and dial up and look for somebody saying something
about piano and I found it. 
I found there was
an old site called the Chopin Files when
I was in high school. 
Then it became defunct, and then I found a
couple other sites. One's called Piano World and Piano Street. They still exist. 
I went on there and just started talking a bunch of
smack about piano, because I was
developing opinions, 
and I would hear
somebody else claim that Horowitz's 1951
Rachmaninoff concerto is 
obviously superior to his
earlier and later renditions, and Martha Argerich's Rach
3 is too indulgent here. 
Of course, they're all received. They weren't my own
opinions and I was trying on different thoughts. 
But I asserted myself
with confidence, and I found message boards
to have these fun debates, 
and ranking the Chopin Etudes
to see what was hardest. But yeah, I needed that. 
KEVIN SCOTT:
Which one do you think is the hardest? BEN LAUDE:
I think it's personal, but for me, it's either the
Double-Thirds Etude 
or the Opus 10 Number
2 in A minor, where you have to, in
your third, fourth, and fifth fingers, play
a rapid chromatic scale 
while you also accompany yourself. Basically, an oom-pah-pah
in the same hand as this insane spidery thing. 
At the time, I couldn't
touch these pieces. I was still getting better, 
and I was in awe of
those who could, and I wanted to find everybody I could who had the same
fascination for me, 
and without the Internet,
I wouldn't have done that. Also, without video in
my pre-YouTube era, 
when the Internet was helping to stimulate this interest, I needed to watch these things, 
and I could listen because
I could go to Barnes and Noble to the CD
section and buy some, or even Tower Records
was around back then I 
could buy some classical CDs, and I would collect
them with whatever a little bit of money that
I had in high school. 
That's what I
splurged it all on. It was just CDs and scores, but I wanted to
watch these things. I was lucky enough to
catch something on 
PBS at some point
about Evgeny Kissin. I remember my teacher
had a couple of 
VHS tapes that he let
me borrow and a DVD, and one of them was a documentary called
the Art of Piano, 
which chronicled all
the famous pianists of the 20th century, and that was the
first time I heard 
of people like Arrau, Horowitz, Serkin, Gould, and
some of the early golden age KEVIN SCOTT:
It's the first time I 
ever heard of Cziffra right? Who is unbelievable. BEN LAUDE:
Yeah, but also to see 
it was a big deal. There was an aura around
these old videos. 
Now, everything is on YouTube. Every day I get
recommended a new, 
this is not video, but a
new Carnegie Hall recital from Horowitz from the '40s. He played there probably a
handful of times every year. 
There's dozens of these
things that exist. But as a kid, just to have one live
recording of Horowitz 
from Carnegie Hall
would make me flip out. I really needed the Internet, 
and I needed video and a couple
of years before YouTube. YouTube was such a game
changer for this obsession. 
It came right at
the time I was in college when my
obsession was peaking. But in the years before that, 
I found random websites. One was called
rareclassicaldvds.com. 
I needed it in particular because I wanted
to get my hands on a particular
Horowitz performance 
that apparently
was a total bust. In Tokyo, he was
mixing medications, 
and he just completely. But I was fascinated by the fact that
Horowitz screwed up. 
I was like, I have to
hear this performance. Before it was available, 
I ordered some
Horowitz in Moscow, DVDs like that. I
had this obsession. 
Again, nobody, except
my piano teacher, maybe in his younger
years, cared about this. 
There was actually
nowhere I could find anyone. I wasn't going to school and trying to convince
people to like this thing. 
I played on the basketball team. Again, I was just, whatever. It was something I tried
to hide, to be honest. 
The Internet was a
place for me to go and find a community of
like minded people. 
Actually, it was amazing
when I started my channel, I got an early Patreon supporter
and the guy reached 
out and he's some business or finance guy about
around my age. He said, hey, I
remember you from 
the piano forums in the 2000s. I was Alkan88. I was
like, I remember that. 
These people I met
at the time with these pseudonyms are
coming back into 
my life now and finding my work. It's coming full
circle, I suppose. 
KEVIN SCOTT:
If you're playing Rachmaninoff Concertos, when you're in high school, 
you're super talented, it sounds like you had
all the passion that you 
need to decide to go
to school to study. How did you think about
this as a career? 
Were you just purely driven by the passion
for this thing, or did you have these
rational thoughts about, 
this is what the odds are of being a concert
pianist in this world. 
BEN LAUDE:
For better or worse, my dad raised me with an almost American dream mentality 
of you can be whatever you
want to be in this country. While I don't think
that's exactly 
as true as maybe he
was making it seem, I was lucky that
he thought that. 
But also for that reason, I had no rational
calculus at all. It was a matter of 
first getting a taste of the fact that this does
go on in the real world. Remember, I'd only
been on the Internet. 
Before I was going to
commit myself to this, I had to meet people
actually doing it. 
Luckily, between my junior and senior year of high school, I went to New Orleans,
Piano Institute, camp. 
There's a competition that
happens at the same time. I went there and it was like, me and a couple of other
high school age people, 
but a lot of college
age students, a couple of years older than me, who were studying
piano in college. 
I felt like I was on their level or at
least near their level, 
and I loved it. I finally could just like, talk about my passion and my hobby and share
it with them and go 
to international
competitions every night and watch
amazing pianists, maybe five, 10 years older
than me, do their thing. 
That made it real. That's when I was like, people, you can do this. 
There is a major in college. You could major in music.
You can major in piano. I still find it totally
bizarre that that's 
a thing and yet the moment
that it became real to me, 
I think it was just instant. I was like, this
is what I'm doing. College, again, it was
sold as a time to explore. 
It was a time to
not have to decide. Even though music
majors are the ones - at 
Rice where I went,
who had to commit, we actually had to declare our
major before we got there. Everybody else got a year
or a year and a half or so. 
We were the ones who knew it. At the same time, there
was this feeling of, well, I could always
change my course. 
I was interested in
math and other things. I even got into Northwestern for a double degree in math and 
music and ended
up going to Rice. I knew I had other interests and skills and
could always turn. 
But I wasn't really
thinking about that. I was just so happy that
this career path existed, 
and I was so at the beginning of it that I
wasn't thinking longer term. 
KEVIN SCOTT:
It's a super interesting profession and a practice. 
Someone asked me one time, I was actually at 
a computer science conference
with fellow PhD students. We were in Vancouver, 
and I went to some Virgin
Records in Vancouver, and I actually found
the Art of Piano, 
that DVD there and I bought it. They were like, why are you
so fascinated with piano? 
Like you're a
computer scientist? I was like, there's
some part of it, I can't explain at all. 
I have no idea. But part of it is I
love this idea that 
pianists and programmers share this struggle that they have, 
where you've got
this machine that doesn't really want to do
what you wanted to do, 
that you have to sit
down at and conquer. You just have to figure
out its complexities 
and figure out how to
extract out of it, what you have in your head. It's a little bit of
a solitary activity, 
that act of mastering this tool like no
one can do for you, 
and there are very few
shortcuts for accelerating it. You've just got to
put the hours in. 
I even heard, I think, on one of these Horowitz
VHS tapes that I watched, 
Horowitz's manager
described it. He was like, pianists
sometimes can have 
this strange psyche because what they do is a
solitary activity. They sit alone in a room and 
wrestle with this great machine. BEN LAUDE:
First of all, you really know your stuff. You know all of these
great documentaries 
and performances of
classical piano. I'm impressed and flattered 
to know that that you
like a thing I like. But, yeah, you're
absolutely right. I think Martha Argerich
once said that, 
her solo recitals just felt like the loneliest time in the world. That's not every pianist. 
Arthur Rubinstein was very much present with his audience, and he said that he would even 
imagine a pretty girl in the
audience and play for her, but he loved to share
live performance. 
I think I'm more on the Argerch or even Gouldian
side of things. Because of frankly, it wasn't concerts that
got me into music. 
It was recordings and it was
a very private activity. In fact, I still feel
uncomfortable when I go 
to a live concert. Everybody is around me. Can you guys leave? Can I
just be in here alone? 
Because it is a
private experience for the listener as well. But as a pianist, just sitting in a room
for hours on end. 
It is, I suppose,
similar to programming. There's an input and an output, and the output is not
always what you want. 
There's something going
on on the inside, and there's probably
bugs in there and who knows? But I like piano 
because compared with other instruments,
which I never got into. Although, now I regret that. I wish I were more 
diverse in my
instrumental skill sets, the way musicians
used to have to be, 
but I am a pianist. Only one week of string camp. Can't remember any
of that. But I like 
that the pianist is detached from the
production of sound. 
That's actually invisible to us. Now, this could be
a trap for pianists who start approaching
piano too much 
like typing or a button
pressing activity. 
But actually, your connection, it's such an ingenious design 
from the early
industrial revolution that your actual
physical activity is immediately triggering this, 
hammer at this
complex hammer action and escapement on the
inside of the instrument. But you can't see that. 
All you have is this interface, and you have to develop
a connection with that. 
It's really hard and I'm
still trying to do it better, and I'm trying to help
other people do it better. But I think the
biggest difference 
between piano and coding
because otherwise, they have a lot of
interesting similarities, the solitary nature, 
it's just the physical
and athletic requirement. At the end of the day, piano is an intense physical activity. 
We're all injured.
We don't like to talk about it, but
we're all injured. Maybe you coder types get a
little injured sometimes, 
maybe a little like, my
neck hurts or something. You need some
occupational therapy. But pianists actually we 
need serious help
sometimes with this. KEVIN SCOTT:
I forget what the story is. 
Didn't Schumann wreck his hands because he made these
little exercises? 
BEN LAUDE:
They didn't know much about piano technique in
the 19th century. The people who did it well, I think, figured it
out naturally. 
They had all these ridiculous
ideas like he was trying to get independence
in his fourth finger. 
The fourth finger is conjoined. Chopin said it was the Siamese. These are the Siamese
twins of the hand 
and they're conjoined right here. What he thought was that he needed a contraption to learn how
to isolate each finger. 
Well, it turns out, we
know this now, also from research in
the 20th century that isolating your
fingers is basically 
a ticket to having a career
ending, debilitating injury. 
That's what happened to Schumann. He came up with
this contraption to try to help isolate
the fourth finger, and it ended up ruining him, 
contributing in
part to his misery, although it's good to have miserable composers
because of the music... 
KEVIN SCOTT:
He squeezed some beautiful,
beautiful stuff out of the misery. 
BEN LAUDE:
I don't want too happy a composer. Chopin was just so
melancholy all the time, 
and would we have wanted
him to be different? Maybe we want
Chopin to be happy, but we're okay with the
results he put into his music. 
But yeah, for sure, there's a lot more knowledge now about what to do and what
not to do with the hand. 
Although I still
think not enough, and it's not standardized,
and there's still a lot more research that
needs to be done into it. 
There's a lot of gurus and a
lot of schools of thought, and they all have their dogmas. 
Actually, part of my
work at Tonebase was just trying to collect
these people and say, let's get what these
different experts 
are saying about
piano technique, and what's interesting is how often they disagree
with each other. It's still a heated debate, 
but at least we know
that we shouldn't be putting our fingers in
these contraptions anymore. 
KEVIN SCOTT:
It really is interesting. I'm not surprised at all
that you have people 
having wildly different
opinions about interpretation. One of the weird things...
God bless YouTube. 
I do think it is actually one of the most wonderful things ever, not just for piano nerds, 
but any nerd you want to
go obsess on something. But I watched just this
morning, preparing for this. 
I want to talk about the
instrument and the art 
as like two different things because when you think
about something like AI, 
like if you think about AI as both instrument
and art together, 
you just are getting confused. But if you think about
AI as an instrument for 
an artist to use to
go make something, it becomes altogether
interesting. 
I was watching this
morning Murray Perahia doing a master class in 2022
on the G minor Ballade, 
Chopin, which is my
favorite piece of music. Murray, one of his performances 
is my very favorite
performance of that. 
The part of that Ballade that moves me the most is
the leadup to bar 106. 
When you release
all of the tension, it's like that
double fortissimo. It's the big dramatic moment
in the middle of the piece. 
What he was asking
this student to do is, there's this chord in
the leadup to 106, 
and he's like, what
does death sound like? He's like, this is death. 
He's like, you need
to have this passage, 
this line that you're
playing be foreboding, and as if death is chasing you. 
Not everybody has
that in their mind, like when they're playing
that particular passage. 
I know Zimmerman's got
a different thing. I've seen Steven Hough do a master class
on the same thing. 
That's the thing that's just
super fascinating to me. It's like you can have
the same instrument 
and the same score and get something fundamentally
different out of it for you, 
the performer, and it lands on the audience
in a different way. Murray's performance of this, it 
sends goosebumps up my spine
every time I listen to it. I've listened to it
hundreds of times. 
Zimmerman's performances
are very, very good. It just doesn't do the same
thing, and I don't know why. 
BEN LAUDE:
Is interesting that there's almost no spoilers in classical music. It's almost the reverse. 
It's knowing what's coming that builds the anticipation and
the goosebumps, and for me, 
it's knowing a piece really
well that makes, if it's a great piece, that makes repeated listenings
so meaningful. 
But yeah, it's interesting to compare what you're
describing to AI, and you would know much more
about this than I would. 
But at least from
what I can tell, classical piano
and the literature and the art of interpreting it, 
these are expressions
of human consciousness. Chopin's first Ballade is an 
expression of his
organized consciousness, and he's expressing something. 
The only way we can
agree about the piece is if we just speak
in generalities. Well, it's dramatic. It seems to tell a
story, whatever. 
But the moment you get into
details and you want to talk about how this phrase
should be rendered, 
it's death for Murray Perahia. It's life affirming
for somebody else. It's dark for this interpreter. 
It's bright. It's dry for Glenn Gould, it's wet for Horowitz. There's just suddenly the
interpreter's consciousness 
is then mixed with
the composer's. You get a new cocktail of whatever thing we
can't describe. 
Maybe one day we will
be comparing Horowitz and Perahia's Chopin Ballade to AI's 
different version of it, and we can input "Well, I want to hear an AI
play it with this expression." 
I don't know. You might
have a comment on that. Is that coming? Should
we be concerned? 
KEVIN SCOTT:
I've had this conversation with people, and I don't think it does, 
because I think the point of a thing like
classical piano is, 
you have something inside of
you that you're trying to express that's difficult or impossible to express
any other way. 
It's like part of your humanity. 
It has meaning if you just
play it for yourself, and it has a different
meaning if you play it 
for an audience who are going to receive it in probably
a different way than 
you are maybe even
intending when you play it. 
Like I'd never thought of death before hearing
Murray's performance 
until I saw him
teach that Master Class. That's not the thing
I'm thinking of. It's like just this
incredible emotional response 
that I get to it that I
can't really put words on. I think that's a beautiful
connection that you've made, 
even though maybe that's not even what he was
intending to do. BEN LAUDE:
Well, the whole question of 
composers intentions is vexed, but I think it's
interesting what you said because I could
also change your mind. 
One of the things about
my videos is I think I've converted a few people
to Glenn Gould, who would have never 
thought they would
want to listen to him, but also I made
these videos about Yunchan Lim, and even though 
KEVIN SCOTT:
Except for Seymour Hoffman. You didn't change his mind. BEN LAUDE:
Seymour Bernstein, yeah. KEVIN SCOTT:
Bernstein, sorry. 
BEN LAUDE:
Well, Philip Seymour Hoffman, RIP. But Seymour Bernstein
still kicking at 97. 
Didn't change his mind,
but he did respect my longer Gould documentary
that I made a few months ago. 
I was able to have an
exchange with him. I loved having that debate 
with Seymour because
we were able to distill two perfectly
valid conceptions and 
approaches and ways of regarding the playing of Mozart
Brahms and Bach. 
He gave the argument
on personal feeling. For him Glenn Gould fails in 
terms of connecting
with his sense of the way one should touch 
and turn these phrases so that
they speak from the heart. I said back to him
you're absolutely right. 
He doesn't speak from the heart. Gould is up to something else. I mean, he's trying to design these almost sonic
aural landscapes 
that are organic and speak on their own terms
and aren't related to our personal feelings, but somehow float above us. 
They're part of the cosmos. They're hypnotic. They're often, they have
a regularity to them, 
and it feels like the
universe is pulsating and that we're just
attaching ourselves. 
It's a very different
aesthetic experience, listening to music than
wanting to be touched, wanting to be moved, 
and feel. That's
what's great about it. You can feel all kinds of things up here and here and here. 
Then when we have
discussions and debates, it's not about being right. It's about learning more
about what it means to 
feel something
personally or what it might mean to experience
art in a different way. Just the comments on
those videos about Gould, 
and I'd say about
Yunchan, too. I mean, not
everybody thought Yunchan's performance was 
the greatest Rachmaninoff
of all time, and they let me know
it in the comments, but it became even more
interesting because I got to 
see: what did I hear that
made me like it so much? Then I had to examine
my own biases 
and my own influences, and I realized some
people are expecting something completely
different from this piece. 
That's where it becomes
about this human interchange and human exchange of ideas. 
Perhaps if an AI
interfered with that, they would be just a nuisance. 
KEVIN SCOTT:
A couple of things what you just said
made me think. 
Like, one is I
think artists like Glenn Gould, 
Horowitz is the same way, part of what makes them
exciting to me is, 
they're not consistent across their performances of
the same repertoire. 
There's this Glen Gould performance of Bach's Italian concerto, where, third movement
he's playing, 
like at this rip roaring tempo
BEN LAUDE: Bat out of hell, yeah KEVIN SCOTT: That's the one 
that I love. 
I find it incredibly compelling. Then later on in life
he plays it at like, 
what must be just half
the tempo that he was playing in that
younger recording. 
And it's like, I don't care for it. But he's evidently had
some reconceiving of 
what it is he's looking
for in the score. BEN LAUDE:
He did it with the Italian Concerto, 
but most famously with
the Goldberg Variations. That's what he launched
his career with, but then he reflected on
his own interpretation, 
and he realized: This isn't so
organic. It doesn't add up. He says, it just sounds like 30 independent variations
with a mind of their own. 
Gould had a modernist
sensibility. He believed in the
autonomy of art. He believed that
it should somehow 
all operate on its own
logic on its own terms. To have a variety show 
was something too much
out of the mundane world. He wanted the Goldberg
Variations to somehow, again, 
float above our human
engagement with it, and therefore proceed
from one variation to the 
next with a mathematical
proportionality. He mapped this all out,
and for some people, 
they can hear
that measured quality, and it's totally alienating. Sounds like maybe
that might have been 
your experience. I love that. I think that the
fact that he starts with one pulse and he
takes it for an hour, 
and he travels through this
whole spiral of variations, 
and then he comes back
to the beginning, and somehow you felt
like it was one thing. For me, that's just a
towering achievement. 
KEVIN SCOTT:
I love his Goldberg Variations as well. Horowitz, for many years, 
was by far and away,
my favorite pianist. He's still, my single
favorite piece of music, 
my single favorite
performance of it is his. It's Scriabin's Opus 8, No. 12 
The D minor etude. BEN LAUDE:
D#, D# Minor. Not a key 
you want to touch.
It's very prickly. KEVIN SCOTT:
D#, sorry.
His performance in that 1968 televised
concert is I think, 
the most compelling
thing I've ever heard. BEN LAUDE:
That performance is part of 
the reason I'm a pianist. I mean, that exact performance of that exact piece,
when I first saw it, 
also just there was something about the color of that old, CBS live performance
from behind the piano, 
and he comes out with
the strong bass. It's one of the most rhapsodic, 
passionate pieces I ever, I'd never heard
of Scrabin before, and I was an immediate
convert when I saw that. 
Sorry to interrupt you,
but I have to just because it relates to
something you said before. That piece, I had to 
learn it because it's
just like I had to learn. KEVIN SCOTT:
God help you. BEN LAUDE:
Well, yeah, and actually, 
I thought there's no
way I can play it. But in college, again, I had the time to be
crazy enough to sit 
down and figure out how to make all those left hand jumps work. It's good that it's
in D sharp minor, 
because that means you're
almost exclusively playing black keys, which on the page
looks frightening. 
But if you just look
at the keyboard, and you forget about how
all of this is notated, it's actually more
comfortable in 
certain ways to use the
black keys that way. These jumps started to fit, and I realized I
could redistribute 
some with my right hand. I just needed to
basically master a couple of challenging
octave parts, 
and I was starting to do my best Horowitz
interpretation or impression. I took this piece
to Jerry Lowenthal, 
one of my teachers at Juilliard. He hadn't heard me
play it before, and I was about to play it
on the radio somewhere, 
and I just wanted
to run it for him. I come in and I start with the Horowitz just
bashing the left hand 
octaves, ba-dum, dee-da-da, 
you know, just cacophony.  He stops me, "Stop! 
Why does everyone have to try
to play this like Horowitz?" He showed me. 
He said, "You know,
first of all, there's no dynamic
indication at the beginning. You can start very quietly. 
It's extremely effective." Later on, I saw there is a later Horowitz
performance, I think in London. 
We he plays
the same piece, and he begins at
almost Pianissimo. Even Horowitz did the opposite. 
Here I was imitating Horowitz, but I was actually
just imitating one performance that he gave. 
Wow, we're really
nerding out about this. I hope your viewers are down. If you don't know what
we're talking about, guys, 
go watch Vladimir
Horowitz play Scriabin D# Minor Etude, Opus 8 No. 12, 
immediately from 1968. KEVIN SCOTT:
Yeah, it is incredible. 
Which brings me to Yunchan Lim, which I think is a thing
that folks are not familiar. 
Like, they should definitely
go to YouTube or to their favorite streaming
platform or whatnot and 
start listening to some
of the work by this kid. Yet again, one of these things 
that really makes
me believe that, 
that there's just
something very deeply human about this art form that 
I think people can get
very confused about because you've got a
technical instrument and 
a technical discipline of playing. But, like, the thing
that's miraculous 
about it is like the
human piece of it. What I'm talking about,
like Yunchan Lim is, 
like, he's 20-years-old now. Maybe 21. 
BEN LAUDE: Just 20. 
KEVIN SCOTT: A couple of years ago, at the Van Cliburn
Piano competition, which is one of
the world's, like, 
big piano competitions for young musicians to go prove
themselves to the world. 
He wins the competition. There's a concerto performance
at this competition, 
and like everyone was performing the Rachmaninoff's
third piano concerto. 
He comes out and delivers this performance that
was unbelievable. 
Like, one where the
conductor is, like, wiping a tear away from her eyes the orchestra
that was playing 
with him had this crazy
reaction to the performance. 
It's just unbelievable. Up
until that point, like, that 78 Ormandy performance
that Horowitz had given was, 
like, my high watermark. I changed my mind. It was this thing for 50 years was, test of time, so many people
thought it was the best, 
and then all of a sudden,
they're changing their opinion. Part of it was like
the whole performance. 
Like, watching him
play it was part of what made it compelling. 
Look, so everyone
should go watch your analysis of
this performance. 
Because I think it's the
best one on the Internet, trying to explain why it is 
that this young man had done
something extraordinary with a 100-year-old score and 
a multiple hundred
years old instrument that has been played
a million times, 
recorded thousands of times, analyzed within an
inch of its life 
by very smart people
and very great artists. Yet here he comes and
he does something 
new and surprising.
He's amazing. BEN LAUDE:
There's an old romantic notion that music is ineffable. 
It expresses things that
can't be expressed in words. I think we agree that
there's truth to that. 
You even said something
that's similar, but it also, I think has led to a deficit in good
analysis and commentary, 
at least in the popular
mainstream of music. 
There's a fear of talking about what makes a performance great
or an interpretation great. 
It's almost like
explaining a joke. It's like don't do that, it is supposed to hit us and
then leave it alone. 
I remember in college, somebody
giving a lecture recital, and there was somebody
grumbling next to me like, 
Can't we just let the
music speak for itself? That's the thing you're
supposed to say about it. I remember being puzzled because 
I was always overly
analytic about everything. Here I am not letting
music speak for itself, 
but speaking way too
much about music, but people really
appreciated that. I just took his performance, 
and first I clarified
it for myself. What made this connect with me? 
Then when I listened
back and took all these notes on
everything, I realized, Oh, he was listening
to Horowitz here, 
or just he discovered
an inner voice there. It helped that I just heard 
countless performances of
this over the years that I could listen anew and hear
somebody on the one hand, 
synthesizing certain
older interpretations, but also integrating them into his own new new take on it. 
What was fun about what I did, and I think what people
really appreciated is they 
had this moving experience that they couldn't quite explain. To have somebody else
help clarify for them, 
what was so special about it
made them want to re listen. Then when they re
listened and it got to 
those passages, they heard more. They actually heard different, it was a different experience. 
I mean, we think, I've
heard that piece before, or even I've heard
that recording before. But this music is way too rich. 
There's too much going on. There's too much polyphony. There's tens of
thousands of notes. There's infinite ways that you 
could, a variety of ways of approaching
it and phrasing it, that even just listening
to the same recording, 
you're going to
notice a new detail. Or if you do know
a detail's coming, you're going to enjoy it
again in maybe a new way. 
I was actually showing
people that there's a way to listen to 
classical music that they
hadn't experienced before, one that necessitates
re listening, one that requires that
you notice things, 
become aware of
them, and appreciate when others point
things out to you. Because that's how
I got into it. 
I had others be like, "listen
to this moment. Wait for it. Did you hear how they..."
so I loved 
that kind of engagement
with others. YouTube is just for me,
the greatest opportunity 
to platform, to create that. It also allows me to indulge 
my longstanding interest in just creating video,
creating content. I've been editing videos since 
high school projects
and finally, it's coming to good use. Now I get to design
these things where I 
both clarify things for myself in these video
essays and analyses, but also I get to
design the way it 
looks and how the score
appears on the page, and I love editing the music, 
so it's like one performance will sync up suddenly
with another performance. Almost you didn't hear it, but 
now that helps you
hear the difference. Like putting Horowitz and Argerich
and Yunchan back to back. 
It sounds like one
seamless performance, but you can hear. It helps just bring into relief 
what's so different about them. I think I'm just
getting started. I'm just starting to experiment
with these techniques, 
and think other people
should do it, too. I want there to be
a bigger ecosystem of media and classical
music content creators. 
There's some great
ones out there. But for the most
part, what I'm doing, I just feel like, again, feel pretty lonely about it, 
like I used to when I was just practicing Chopin by
myself in the ninth grade. 
It's an exciting time, I think to bring
this otherwise thing 
we're nerding out about
to a broader public. I think a lot of people
are interested in it. 
KEVIN SCOTT:
Yeah, I think you're right. I mean, everyone, I've shown that Yunchan video that you 
made has I think done exactly
what you were intending. 
They've gone back and re
listened to the performance, and they've heard something 
that they wouldn't
have heard before? I've been listening to
classical piano 40 years now. 
It's even influenced the way that I'm listening to things, 
which has been amazing. Have you heard he just
recently made his Brahms debut, 
and he did the Emperor. Like, I think his encore
was Bach's Siciliano. 
The Emperor was amazing. I've listened to the Emperor, 
like, a bazillion times. My default tactic,
before I'm going to sink a half an hour into
this thing is I jump 
forward to the third movement, and I'm like, are they going
to disappoint me here? If they don't, like,
I'll go back to 
the beginning and listen
to the whole thing. BEN LAUDE:
We have a lot in common. I used to actually, 
you mentioned the Horowitz
Ormandy recording. I used to just fast forward
to the last minute of that because he has the most
thrilling last page ever, 
and the audience is going
nuts before he finishes. In a way, it's 
like it's totally wrong to
experience the music that way, but at the same
time, I didn't care. It's like fast forwarding to
the game winning home run, 
the walk off home run at the end and reliving the highlight. I haven't heard his Emperor yet. 
I'm excited to. I've heard his third
and fourth concertos. KEVIN SCOTT:
I will tell you again, 
you should go listen to it,
draw your own conclusion. I won't say too much about it, 
but it is now my favorite
performance of the Emperor. By the fifth bar of 
the third movement, he's already doing
something unusual. He completely ignores 
the fortissimo dynamic
marking on the fifth bar. Usually, it's done
and it repeats. 
On the repeat, he
plays the piano. I'm like, what is
he going to do now? Then I'm just ready
to be on the ride. 
BEN LAUDE:
Yet it feels organic. It doesn't feel gimmicky. 
I was lucky enough to interview Marin Alsop for a video
that hasn't come out yet, but she said something
to this effect. 
His rubatos are always surprising and yet
they seem right. They seem organic and natural. 
There's a lot of
surprising rubato, the taking of time, and musical phrasing
that's not organic. 
That sounds affected or it doesn't communicate or express itself exactly how
the pianist imagines. 
It's hard to know how to feel a phrase in just a way that's going to communicate
with the audience, especially to do
it in a new way. 
Most of our rubatos are just the conventional things
our teacher tell us to do. Yunchan just barely stopped 
being a teenager a
couple of months ago, and he's discovering new ways of articulating what's so great
about his performances, 
especially in the fact that he's champion of
Beethoven and Bach, not just Liszt and Rachmaninoff, 
but he goes back
to the classics. He can play baroque counterpoint like you've never heard before. 
That allows a clarity in the bigger romantic concertos
that I think separates him. 
I'm interested to
hear his Beethoven. He has such fantastic, rhythmic drive and tautness
that anything he does, 
there's a sense that landed
exactly where I wanted it to. It's just extremely
gratifying to hear him 
because I'm getting to know
him better also as a pianist. I feel like I know him personally
because I've heard him 
interpret so many different
pieces, and you're right. It's this sense of
I can't wait to 
hear now what Yunchan has
to say about this piece. You know you've made it as a pianist when
people want to hear 
your version of a work that's been played
a million times. KEVIN SCOTT:
I am dying 
at this point to hear him do the G minor Ballade. 
He'll record it at some point. BEN LAUDE:
I'm sure. KEVIN SCOTT:
It will be interesting. BEN LAUDE:
Well, next year 
he's playing the Goldberg
Variations in Carnegie Hall, and so I look forward to that. 
I got to hear his 24. Actually, he played all 27
of them, Chopin Etudes. He did the extra three
as well, in Carnegie. 
It was phenomenal. KEVIN SCOTT:
I haven't heard him play live yet, 
but I listened to the
recording of those Etudes. It's just pretty
incredible the new things. 
You did an interview
with Manny Ax, where he was talking
about Horowitz, 
where Ax was saying, hey, I think Horowitz could hear 
things in a score
that we couldn't. He chose to put highlights on 
different things or to bring your attention to things
that other performers don't. 
I feel like Yunchan
does that a lot with the Opus 9
No. 2 Nocturne, 
which you know - I
can play that piece but not like he did. [LAUGHTER] 
BEN LAUDE:
Well, he finds secrets in it that nobody ever
knew about before. 
A lot of this does
come back to Bach. I'm wearing the
T-shirt for a reason. When you play enough Bach, 
you start living inside
different voices in a new way. We're trained in our culture
to listen for melody. 
There's melody, and
then there's the band. The band is accompanying you. There's a rhythm
and bass section. Anyone who knows music and 
wants to be a musician
and they get into music often they gravitate towards the base because they realize the secret is the bass is 
actually what
everything grows from. But in Bach's time,
there was still a parity between voices. 
He wrote every voice with
integrity and autonomy. When you practice
enough of that, 
you have to learn
how to give life to inner voices because they 
are just as independent
as the top voice. 
If you're playing fugues or canons or inventions or
anything that Bach wrote, 
there's always this sense of, well, I have to. There's no hierarchy here. 
There's just interplay
of equal voices. Unfortunately, Bach is not, 
I think, taught enough. It's not stressed enough as a real art form
pianists should aspire 
to be able to play
in the highest way. It's more seen as like broccoli, you're supposed to eat
to be more nutritious. 
But Yunchan, he takes the
three-part inventions of Bach, and he makes them
into little miracles. 
He's able to create
art out of this otherwise seemingly archaic
Baroque counterpoint. That gives him a foundation
for playing all of 
this romantic music
or more recent music because he has control
over every element, 
every input that's
going into a texture. Therefore, if it's an
otherwise pleasant Chopin 
Nocturne that's
what just oom-pah-pah on the left hand and the
melody in the right, he's discovering and
showing you through 
his expert finger
independence and ability to balance on just the right
notes to voice them in 
a way that suddenly allows
them to emerge from a texture. That comes from
his Bach training, and it allows his Chopin to 
speak in an absolutely new way. These are all things I want to make videos about, by the way. [LAUGHTER] I need to
write these down. 
But this is the
stuff that I want people to hear because I have so much pleasure myself discovering them and
hearing it for myself. 
Do you have friends who also like piano this
much in your world? 
I don't know. Maybe it is
a thing in the tech world. KEVIN SCOTT:
I have 
friends who are obsessed
about different things. I don't know anyone who's
quite as obsessed as I am. 
[LAUGHTER] This is why I was excited to
talk to you today. [LAUGHTER] But look, 
so here's maybe the way
that I will say it. I think that if you look
at Martha Argerich playing 
a Liszt piano concerto
or Yunchan Lim doing some of these
beautiful things 
with Chopin Nocturnes, or you're watching some
other great feat of 
human performance like Alex
Honnold free soloing El Cap. 
I think there's just
this beautiful thing about watching human beings 
do things that are right at the ragged edge of
human performance, 
and then doing them
in a way where they show everybody else
the art of the possible and something new and 
nuanced and interesting that
you've never seen before. It's the thing, in my world, 
where we get into these debates about
what the role 
of technology is in making art. I always come down
on the side that 
art is about the artist
and the audience, it's not about the instrument. 
Because piano was new
technology at some point. 
The art that comes from AI is only going to be
as interesting as 
the artists who are able to say something new and
interesting and human with it. 
Absent that, it's like a phenomenon that
you're observing and it just doesn't
have a human element. 
I think things that don't have human elements are
very different than things like a
performance that does. 
BEN LAUDE:
I think the instrument, in that sense, is somewhat trivial. It's what humans do with it. 
On the other hand, there's
something special about the particular mechanical
invention of the piano, 
and I would say
the perfection of that instrument in the late
19th or early 20th century right around the same
time the bicycle 
was being perfected
and has never changed. Even if we have motorized bikes 
or AI riding bikes for
us, self-driving bikes, we're also still going
to get on it and pedal because there's
just something perfect 
about how that technology is integrated into a human form. There's something so human
about riding a bike. 
There's something so human
about playing the piano. In that sense, that older
technology really did 
peak in terms of mating
with human beings. You don't need some
singularity to achieve that. 
I do want to say that perhaps some technology doesn't need to be improved on. 
Some things did
reach a pinnacle. I don't know if you
agree with that. 
That's a little sidetrack there. KEVIN SCOTT:
I think, obviously, 
there hasn't needed to be an improvement to the
form factor of the piano. 
One of my very favorite stories, I tell this to
engineers all the time, is, you must have seen the
performances of Josef Hofmann, 
I think there are
two videos of him, one playing the third movement of the Emperor, funny enough, and one of him playing
C# Minor, 
and it's just
unbelievable to watch. One of the stories that
I've heard about, yeah. 
BEN LAUDE:
He comes at you really high. KEVIN SCOTT:
Really high. BEN LAUDE:
He knows exactly where those keys
are going to be. 
KEVIN SCOTT:
One of the awesome things about Hofmann is
he was an inventor. I think he invented
the shock absorber. 
My understanding is he had
a smaller hand than some of the performers like Rachmaninoff 
who were his contemporaries. One of the things that
he did was he had 
a keyboard manufactured where the keys were just a little bit 
smaller so that he could more easily cover a tenth
with his size hand. 
It is just a reminder 
to me that you don't
always have to take the constraints of
technology as given. 
There's nothing holy
about a piano that says that the keys have to and you're just **** out of luck 
being a performer if you weren't born with
a big enough hand. That's a solvable problem. 
BEN LAUDE:
By the way, there's a movement that's developing in the
conservatories that I know a few pianists are pushing 
for every music school to have a slightly sized-down instrument the way Hofmann ordered. 
It's funny that Josef
Hofmann was the dedicatee of Rachmaninoff's third
concerto because 
he never could play it actually, despite being Rachmaninoff's
favorite pianist, one of the greatest
pianists of all time, his hands just weren't
quite big enough. 
Speaking of Rach 3 and bringing this back to Alex Honnold, I do think that we're fascinated 
by the types of people
whose brains are configured in whatever way
that they have enough guts to 
train to climb up El
Capitan with no ropes on. Although I don't want to
push this metaphor too much, 
there is a similarity in
getting up on stage and climbing a Rachmaninoff
mountain with no music. 
It's similar to that
not having any aid. It's the sense of
extreme occasions. 
My wife plays Rach 3. I play Rach 2 and Rach 4. We're a
Rachmaninoff family. 
We're totally nuts. It's still crazy when we're walking on stage but do
one of these things. 
We're questioning
our life choices every time we're
pushed on stage, and yet we do it, and
we're drawn back to it, 
and audiences are
drawn to observe it. I just wonder how
much of that is, we live lives that
are just filled 
with so much banality
[LAUGHTER] that we need extreme occasions,
whether we're the ones 
engaging in them
and performing them or we're just experiencing
them vicariously. We need this sense
of transcending 
that just ordinary
everyday junk that we're used to having
to wait for it. 
KEVIN SCOTT:
I think that's true. At least I do. I have a real appreciation for
people who do hard things. 
I feel like I've
kept you too long. But another impossible piano
thing that I was thinking 
about recently was
Maria Joao Pires 
had this famous incident a whole bunch of years ago
where she was called in 
to sub in for a pianist for a
concert at the last minute. 
She showed up thinking
that she was going to play Mozart's K.488. 
What the orchestra started playing when she was at
the keyboard was 466. 
She's sitting there at the
keyboard, it's on video. She's like what? [LAUGHTER] She's talking to
the conductor saying I can't. 
He's like, you
played it last year, and she plays it. Not only does she play,
it's really good. 
It seems impossible. How could that be? 
You look at it, and it's
a miracle of a thing, and you're like, oh, my God, I'm glad to be a human being 
because I can't do what she did, but at least I'm in
the same species. [LAUGHTER] 
BEN LAUDE:
I feel lucky that I've gotten to see some of this up close. You mentioned this
Chopin Podcast, 
which I'm launching in anticipation for the big
Chopin year next year. We've got the national
competition in January. 
We've got the international
competition in October, so I'm going to be making
lots of Chopin content. 
I just released this video
with Garrick Ohlsson, where he breaks down all of Chopin's innovations
at the keyboard. 
He actually demonstrates from, actually, more than 20. It's 20 different
inventions of Chopin 
but dozens and
dozens of examples in which Chopin was the first to cross the
second finger with 
the fifth finger or to have unrestricted use of the
thumb on black keys. All these cool, just technical
innovations at the piano. 
He breaks them down one by
one and demonstrates them. KEVIN SCOTT:
That's awesome. BEN LAUDE:
No. 
But I went in there to his
home just thinking, well, he's got all the scores by him if we need to
reference those. 
We had not had a
real meeting where I told him you need
to be ready for these 42 excerpts from 
not just the beginnings
of Chopin works, random passages
from inside of him. He just unassumingly sat
down and I called them out 
one at a time and just
off the top of his dome, he gave it to me, 
not just memorized, he remembered it, but beautifully rendered passages to
demonstrate each one. 
The production flew by. It was just totally off
the cuff and unprepared. 
He'd been preparing
his whole life for it. He's a special human being, and so he has the
capacity for it. 
For him, there's a
nonchalance about it all. But for me, I do this thing. 
It was still impressive.
I wish people could see what I was seeing because they're going
to see the end product, 
which is going to be edited. But the true story is that Garrick Ohlsson blew
my mind for two hours. 
There's another piece
of meta content I could just make about
what I witnessed. I think it was similar
for Maria Joao Pires. 
It was just on some level between her ear
and her experience and how long she's lived with 
Mozart's music and
performed these concertos. She sat there slightly puzzled
and shocked for a moment. 
Then she collects
herself and she's like, yeah, I know it, I got
this, and it's amazing. 
KEVIN SCOTT:
It is amazing. Maybe that's a great place to end. 
The thing that's really
interesting to me about this stuff
is the layering. 
It's not just the rendered art, but it's the human
being rendering it, and both are compelling. 
I think we just should
never lose track of that. BEN LAUDE:
I think it's very well 
said and I would just add it's also a historical art form. We are having conversations 
with history with the way
not just human beings alive today think
and feel about music but how they felt about it 100, 
200, 300 years ago. I think that's also special. It's not something we do
enough of in our world 
of finding opportunities
and aspects of culture and art
forms to take us 
back into history and learn something about how
we got to this point. That's just yet another facet 
of classical piano
that I think is so special and cool and that
I wish all your friends 
and all of my friends could
love it as much as we do. I suppose I'll just keep making YouTube videos until
I've achieved that. 
KEVIN SCOTT:
I think that's what you should do. So very last question that I ask every guest before we close. 
You've got a super fun job that you're very
passionate about. 
What do you do in your
spare time when it's not playing piano and making 
YouTube videos about
playing piano? BEN LAUDE:
Two answers to that. 
One, when I worked at Tonebase, I was working on a startup, and so you'd think, Oh, I'm
immersed in music all day. 
But also I was immersed
in metrics and meetings, and learning new
applications and e mails. 
Actually, for a while,
believe it or not, my hobby to get away from my tech job was
practicing the piano. 
I was able to keep
learning repertoire, so that shouldn't count because it is technically
part of the profession. 
But I come from a sports family. It's not something anybody in my field really cares about. 
It seems but it's given me some inspiration for my
videos, sports analysis. I think in sports
media and sports talk, 
I'm borrowing from some
of those techniques, and I wish there were
more of a media network for classical music as
there is for sports. 
But if I just need to
get my mind off of the next six videos that I'm somehow going to have
to make this month, 
or the next piece I have to learn to teach, or
whatever it is. I just turn on just
inane, sports talk, 
people yapping about the NBA and the NFL and so I
enjoy following that. 
It just takes me back
to my childhood. I played sports a lot. I always liked sports
statistics and data, 
and I was into those things. It doesn't even matter. It's just like I put that on, 
and it helps me get away. But other than that, just
spending time with my wife. When spending time
with my family, 
I have such an intense job. I'm always thinking
about the next thing. 
I'm sure you can relate to this. Even I'm never off the clock. At Tonebase, I was always in 
my head planning
the next project, designing the next video, 
or lesson planning
for the next artist, just going on in my head
until suddenly I fell 
asleep and so to be honest, it's something I struggle with. I need to find more
ways to disconnect, 
but I at least have these distractions and
so I like to rekindle some of my interests 
and passions from
when I was younger. At the moment, sports
is one of those. KEVIN SCOTT:
Awesome. Well, this 
has been an amazing
conversation. I'm glad you're out there
doing what you're doing. Thank you so much for taking a 
little bit more than an hour to chat with us today, man. BEN LAUDE:
Thank you, Kevin. It was a real pleasure and an honor to be
on behind the tech. 
CHRISTINA WARREN:
What a fantastic conversation with Ben Laude. I'm going to be honest with you. 
I took piano lessons as a kid, but I actually primarily
took voice lessons. I don't know a lot
about classical piano. 
I have sometimes been
served by the algorithm, various classical music
or music interpretation, 
things that I've
washed and enjoyed. But a lot of what the
two of you were talking about completely over my head. 
But I had a great time, and it actually made me
want to go back and watch some of his videos and really see if I
can pick up more, 
get more of the intricacies of what you were talking about. I want to ask you real
quick before we get 
into some of what you
two talked about. How did you discover, Ben? How did you come across
him to begin with? 
KEVIN SCOTT:
Since I was a little kid for
whatever reason, and I still don't
entirely understand it. 
I've always found piano to
be a compelling instrument. It may be all the way back. 
It being my favorite part of
going to church on Sunday. We had this little old lady
who was dear and sweet 
who had taught herself how to play piano at
a pretty high level, and that was the part of 
that Sunday that I
always enjoyed the most. I would try to go sit in
the church as close as 
possible so that I could see her hands when she
played because I was just fascinated by
the whole thing. 
I've just been hooked ever
since and It was hard to be 
hooked on classical piano in
rural Central Virginia in the 70s and 80s because this was not what the cool kids did. 
There was nobody else
who was around me, who was obsessed by this stuff, 
nobody to talk to and no
Internet to go explore. 
I've been on YouTube. 
One of the amazing
things about YouTube is from pretty early
on in the platform, people started posting
piano performance there. 
The volume has just been
higher and higher and then so, I'm constantly on
the lookout for 
new and interesting classical piano content on the Internet. Then I've been watching 
Ben's content for
a whole bunch of years now ever since
Tonebase first 
got started, because honestly, from I think he 
said it in the interview like
he borrows a whole bunch of techniques from
sports reporters like people who are commenting on 
sports performance and it really does make his
content accessible. 
He's talking about
piano performance instead of sports performance. But it's a similar approach and 
it's really fun to watch
his content, I think. CHRISTINA WARREN:
Yeah, totally. 
I've seen some of his videos and also
I've been served, like I said, from the algorithm, weirdly a bunch of drum videos, 
where people do similar
things where they analyze drum performances
and drum solos. Mostly, in that case,
not in classical works. 
KEVIN SCOTT:
If you like drum videos like the thing, like somehow or
another algorithm, put this in my feed
the other week. 
There's this platform
called Drumeo. CHRISTINA WARREN:
That's what I saw, 
and the musicians who play the things
without ever hearing it, without ever hearing
the drum part. KEVIN SCOTT:
Yeah. The best thing 
on their platform is the drummer from the Red
Hot Chili Peppers playing 
this 30 seconds to
Mars song where he gets to hear the song
with no drum in the track. 
He listens to a few bars of it, and then he just nails
it. It's unbelievable. CHRISTINA WARREN:
Nails it. 
No it is, and actually, it's
funny because I was thinking about that a
little bit while the two, you and Ben were talking 
about the different
interpretations of work which is so interesting. 
Because it is interesting. In this case, it's someone
who doesn't even have the notations to go on. They
don't even have the notes. 
They literally are hearing
all the other parts and are having to create fill
in the drum parts. But in some ways, 
it's very similar
to classical music where you have the
work as it's written, but it can be interpreted
different ways. 
Even his example in one case, he was trying to replicate 
another pianist approach
to a piece of work. But that was only one aspect 
of that piece of work
that it turns out. That was only one instance
where it was played. It became very famous, but it wasn't even the
way that he did it all 
the time and that to me is such an interesting and I
think unique part of music. 
In some ways, I feel there are direct juxtapositions
that you can draw to tech because you can create
a function and you 
can create a program that can solve the same
thing multiple ways. But in some ways, it goes
against some of our thinking in 
ones and zeros way because you want things to always build and
run a certain way. 
I was curious from your perspective of
someone who is deeply into piano and is also
deeply into tech. 
Where do you see some of maybe
the similarity points in how art and code intersect? 
KEVIN SCOTT:
Yeah, I've always thought that there
was this thing going on with code that is 
more than just a
mechanical thing. One of the reasons that I've
loved being a programmer for 
so many years is I
have these ideas in my head and things 
that I want to do
that are difficult to articulate or difficult to accomplish any other
way than writing code. 
In a certain sense, it
feels more like a mode of expression than it feels like 
this mechanical thing
where it's like, I got to crank this
code out and get 
it done on time and punch
the clock and done. There's some amount of grinding 
that that you have to do to accomplish interesting things at 
scale in teams of other people. But the very best moments that I've had
as a programmer like, 
I feel like I'm
expressing something and it feels like you're
making a little piece of art, 
and the aesthetic aspect
of what you're doing is maybe just as important or 
more important than the
mechanical aspect of it. I think that's pretty
similar to what you're 
doing with piano performance. It is completely and utterly 
uninteresting to listen to
a piano performance where the pianist is just
robotically playing 
exactly the notes
that are on the score as noted by the composer. 
The thing that audiences, I think are looking for is, what do you as the
performer bring to 
this score that is
interesting or different? How do you help us hear 
something that we've
never heard before? What is it about you
in the moment of 
the performance that is interesting that we
can connect with? I think that's just it's
the interesting thing. 
Ben and I chatted about this. There is this aspect of 
piano performance and computer programming
that's the same. You've got this machine. It's
unruly. It's complicated. 
It takes a long time to master, the process of
mastering it requires 
that mostly it's you and
the machine wrestling. 
It can be a solitary activity. But I think the
interesting thing 
about both of those media is
not that mechanical thing. 
It's not the fact
that, like, hey, I'm a good programmer
now and I can write like 
this huge range of
programs, or like, hey, I have the dexterity and 
all the theory in
my head and I can play any score that you
stick in front of my nose. 
Interesting thing is what
you choose to do with that capability and who
you're doing it for. 
CHRISTINA WARREN:
Yes. No, I think well said. I think that that's true
for both disciplines 
and it's also one of those things this is true
with code and with art, how you create something
and how it's interpreted. 
What your intent and how things are interpreted
can be different. What your intent is
when you put code out in the world and how
people use it are different. 
Same with music, how someone writes a score
or even releases a produced piece of work
and how it's interpreted 
and how it makes people
feel are not the same. Sometimes, they can be
but they're not always. 
That I think is pretty magical regardless what
we're talking about. 
KEVIN SCOTT:
I've been having this argument with a bunch of people for the best
bunch of months. There are some people who 
some of these like
their videos online. Reed Hoffman and I did
a conversation with JJ Abrams about AI
and film making. 
JJ is a super good friend, but I've got a slightly
different point of view about where
things are likely headed. 
My point of view is art is not about the instrument 
and AI is the instrument here. Art is about what humans
choose to do with 
the instrument and I think, 
we've seen it in
every other flavor of technological instrument
that we've ever built. 
The interesting thing about
it is how it gets wielded. It's not a thing in and of
itself that's particularly 
compelling unless
you're a technician. There are things about pianos. 
There's this newish
piano company Fazioli. You would think that
pianos don't need 
refinement and no new piano companies need to get created. But there's this Italian piano company that
got created over 
the past handful
of decades that's making what many people believe are the
world's best pianos. 
If you're the
founder of Fazioli, you're very interested
in the instrument. But even then, the
instruments is only worth 
making if you can
find artists who want to play it to go make
something interesting with. 
CHRISTINA WARREN:
Exactly. If they can do things, cameras are the same way. You've had so many
camera advancements, 
and that can be used by maybe a greater cross section
of people than pianos. However, it's the
exact same thing. 
The Lyn's technology and the sensor technologies and
what's being done is only useful if the people who are 
really technicians and are really skilled with what
they can do with it. KEVIN SCOTT:
I think that's 
a very good example because a camera is absolutely
ubiquitous right now. 
All of us have a better
camera in the pockets than our parents ever had
in their entire lifetime. 
CHRISTINA WARREN:
Yes. KEVIN SCOTT:
They're extraordinarily good cameras. That does not mean that
you can take a good photo. 
A good photo photo is you
see something that you want to encapsulate in a photograph 
that actually has
a point of view, and that when you show
it to someone else, 
it helps them see
a thing that they can't see with
their own two eyes. CHRISTINA WARREN:
Absolutely. Some of 
the best photographs
I've ever taken were with a Hogu camera that
when I was in college, it was a toy camera that I
retrofitted to a Polaroid. 
It's not great resolution, and some of the other
things aren't good, but just the shots I
was able to get and 
some of the things that I
got with it are some of my favorites whether other
people think that or not, has nothing to do
with the tool itself. 
Like you said, it's what
the person is seeing, what they're able
to create with it. I don't know what your
thought is on this. 
I think we might align,
but the way I look at AI is that we
need to be cautious about how these things
can be over used 
and maybe used in some ways
that that we don't want. But I firmly believe that the best musicians are 
going to use these as
just another tool, the same way they've
been using technology 
for decades and that
it's not going to take someone who's not
a musician and make 
them one but it
will be something that will take artists and maybe enhance or augment what they do. 
KEVIN SCOTT:
Yeah. I think you and I are aligned. I think in the hands of 
someone who's got a vision
and a point of view and creativity that it will let
them do extraordinary things. 
But I think if you don't
have those things, like if you're not
very deliberate about 
how can I use the tool to the extent of its ability to make something extraordinary, 
you're not going to get anything
extraordinary out of it. CHRISTINA WARREN:
Definitely. 
I'm grateful that we have people like Ben
who are teaching people the fundamentals
and are talking about and interpreting
and dissecting, 
and doing the play by play
so that even people like me can have more respect 
and grasp more about
the works we hear. KEVIN SCOTT:
Yeah, it was a fun conversation. 
CHRISTINA WARREN:
Absolutely. That is all the time that
we have for today. Thank you so much to Ben
Laude, for joining us.
